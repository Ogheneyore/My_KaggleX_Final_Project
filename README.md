AFRICA FOOD PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT BY FLORENCE O. EGHWRUDJE
Introduction
Africa is a continent with immense potential for food production and supply improvement. With the right strategies in place, Africa can become self-sufficient in its food supply while also providing an abundance of nutritious foods to the rest of the world.

Project Aims
The project seeks to evaluate three datasets, namely: Food Production, Food Supply and Africa Population, in order to gather insights on the Africa food production and supply trends with visualizations that can assist the continent of Africa's policy makers in making suitable decisions in guaranteeing food security in Africa.

Project Description
Using data to make informed decisions about Africa' food production and supply.

Data Source
Data was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelonuoha/africas-food-production-and-supply-2004-2013 and the World Bank open source data on population from 1960 to 2021 (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

Problem
How has the food production and food supply improved in Africa?

Questions
What is Africa food production trend overtime?

What are the top 10 Africa most produced food?

What country has the most food produced in Africa?

What country has the most food supplied in Africa?

Use Case
Agriculture

Conclusion
What is Africa food production trend overtime?

The trend of food production in Africa has been on a steady incline over the past few decades. However, there was production decrease in 2007 and thereafter an increase in 2008 up to 2013.

There has also been an increase in food supply in Africa between 2004 and 2013 as the year increases.

What are the top 10 Africa most produced food?

The top 10 most produced food in Africa between 2004 and 2013 are Cassava, Sugar Cane, Maize and products like, Yam, Vegtables, Milk (excluding butter), Sorghum and Products, Wheat and Products, Beverages, Fermented and Potatoes.

What country has the most produced food in Africa?

Nigeria has the highest food production in Africa with a value of 54,000 kiloton of food production in 2012, 52,000 kiloton in 2011 and 53,000 kiloton in 2013 than any other Africa country.

What country has the most supplied food in Africa?

Egypt had a lot more food accessible for consumption in 2012 than other African nations per capita between 2004 and 2013, despite the fact that Nigeria, Egypt, and South Africa were the top three food producing nations between those years

Recommendation for further Analysis:

-Using the Perason Correlatation Test to get more statistical insights from the datasets.

-Feature Engineering.

-Data Modelling.

-Data validation and testing.

-Making Predictions.

Acknowledgement

I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be part of the BIPOC KaggleX program cohort 2022 and have been immensely lucky to have had an amazing mentor (Ayman Mohamed) throughout this journey. I would like to express my utmost gratitude towards my mentor, who has not only guided me through every step but also imparted invaluable knowledge that has helped shape me as a professional. Additionally, I am thankful to mentor Abdulwasiu Tiamiyu who painstakenly went through my codes and made some great inputs and many thanks to other mentees (especially Kehinde, Divine and Favour) who have provided invaluable insights into various aspects of data science. This experience will stay with me forever!
